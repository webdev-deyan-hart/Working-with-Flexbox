# Working-with-Flexbox
A repo that shows my progress with flexbox

Nothing major will be created here. Any commits made here are simply for the purpose of my getting used to making 'Atomic Commits'. Mistakes will be made, and that's okay. That's how I learn so I won't make these
same mistakes later on the job.
